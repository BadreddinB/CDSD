# SMS Spam Detection using Deep Learning

## Business Problem

AT&T processes millions of SMS messages every day.

A growing proportion of these messages are unsolicited or malicious (spam), negatively impacting:

- User experience

- Trust in the network

- Customer retention

- Support workload

Manual filtering methods do not scale to this volume.

The objective of this project is therefore to design an automated deep learning pipeline capable of classifying SMS messages as:

- Spam

- Ham (legitimate message)

based solely on their textual content.

This system could ultimately support real-time filtering at network level.

## Analytical Objective

The problem is formulated as a binary text classification task on non-structured data.

Given an SMS message:

Predict whether the message should be filtered as spam before reaching the end user.

A key business constraint is the high cost of false negatives:

-> A spam message incorrectly classified as legitimate directly reaches the user.

Therefore, model selection focuses on:

- Spam Recall
rather than overall accuracy.

## Dataset

| Property        | Value              |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Dataset size    | 5,572 SMS messages |
| Spam messages   | ~13%               |
| Ham messages    | ~87%               |
| Missing values  | None               |
| Target variable | Spam / Ham         |

The dataset is strongly imbalanced, requiring specific treatment during training.

## Text Preprocessing

A custom cleaning pipeline was applied:

- Lowercasing

- Removal of punctuation and special characters

- Stopwords removal (NLTK)

- Porter stemming

⚠️ A lighter preprocessing pipeline (without stemming) was used for transfer learning models in order to preserve the linguistic structure expected by pretrained embeddings.

## Model Development

### Baseline Model — LSTM

A sequential neural network including:

- Trainable embedding layer

- LSTM layer

- Sigmoid output

Results:

- Accuracy: 98%

- Spam Recall: 89%

- Spam F1-score: 0.94

This provides a strong baseline but remains sensitive to class imbalance.

### Handling Class Imbalance — GAN Augmentation

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was trained on spam messages to generate:

-> 500 synthetic spam samples

These generated messages were added to the training dataset in order to:

- Improve class representation

- Increase model exposure to spam patterns

- Reduce bias towards the majority class

### Transfer Learning — GloVe + LSTM

Pretrained GloVe word embeddings (100-dimensional) were integrated as a frozen embedding layer.

Results:

- Accuracy: 97%

- Spam Recall: 86%

- Spam F1-score: 0.92

Static embeddings show limitations on short informal text messages.

### Transfer Learning — DistilBERT

A fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer model was trained on the GAN-augmented dataset.

Unlike GloVe, DistilBERT generates contextual embeddings where each word representation depends on its surrounding context.

Results:

- Accuracy: 98%

- Spam Recall: 99%

- Spam F1-score: 0.96

249 out of 252 spam messages were correctly identified.

### Model Comparison

| Model         | Accuracy | Spam Recall | Spam F1 |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Baseline LSTM | 98%      | 89%         | 0.94    |
| GloVe + LSTM  | 97%      | 86%         | 0.92    |
| DistilBERT    | 98%      | **99%**     | 0.96    |

-> DistilBERT was selected as the final model

due to its superior spam recall — the most critical business metric.
